            Here's a paragraph within a div. This paragraph is the child element of the div that contains it. It's a bit
            longer than the previous paragraphs. I'm going to try to do some fun things with this text.

        <p id="para2">
            Here's another paragraph within a div. Once again, this paragraph is the child element of the div that
            contains it. It's a bit longer than the previous paragraphs. I'm going to try to do some different but
            equally fun things with this text.
